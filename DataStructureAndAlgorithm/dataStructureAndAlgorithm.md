What is Data Structure?
Data structure [DS] is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.
So that later it can be accessed quickly and easily.

Importance:
They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms
They help to manage and organize data
They make code clearer and easier to understand

An Abstract Data type:
An ADA is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which data structure must adhere to.
The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.
What is Data Structure?
It is a way to organize data
After organizing data it becomes easy to process it.
Ex library
Types of DS
Linear and Non Linear
Linear -> they’re arranged sequentially so that each member is connected to its previous and next element. As they’re connected sequentially, it becomes easy to traverse them and usually traversal is a single level
Ex : array, LinkedList, stack , queue
Non- linear - > not in sequence, they’re basically connected to one another through different paths, and as in linear data structure, they were single-level, but in non linear they’re stored in multi-level and as they are multilevel, in order to traverse each element in these non-linear data structure takes some amount of time.
Ex : tree and graph
What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a set of instruction to perform a task or to solve a given problem 
Analysis of Algorithm
-	An algorithm is a set of instructions to perform a task or to solve a given problem
-	There are several different algorithms to solve a given problem
-	Analysis of algorithm deals in finding best algorithm which runs fast and takes in less memory
Algorithm is decided based on the time and space complexity
To find the time and space complexity, we use an external or a special tool to determine
Asymptotic analysis of an Algorithm
-	Used to determine the time and space complexity
-	Asymptotic analysis helps in evaluating performance of an algorithm in terms of input size and its increase
-	Using asymptotic analysis we don’t measure actual running time of algorithm
-	It helps in determining how time and space taken by algorithm increases with input size 
What are Asymptotic Notations?
-	Asymptotic Notations are the mathematical tools used to describe the running time of an algorithm in terms of the input size
-	Ex: performance of car in 1ltr of petrol
It helps in determining – best case
		Average case and the worst case of an algorithm 
Types of Asymptotic Notations
There are 3 notations for performing runtime analysis of an algorithm 
1.	Omega Notation – Ω
2.	Big O notation
3.	Theta Notation
1.	Omega Notation – it is a formal way to express the lower bound of an algorithm running time 
2.	Lower bound means for any given input this notation determines best amount of time an algorithm can take to complete
